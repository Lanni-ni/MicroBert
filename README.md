# Coptic NER with MicroBERT

This repository presents a fine-tuned Named Entity Recognition (NER) system for Coptic, leveraging **MicroBERT**, a lightweight BERT model designed for low-resource languages.

## **Preparing the NER Dataset**

The dataset comes from two parts:

- Golden dataset  
- Silver dataset

Both are from: [https://github.com/CopticScriptorium/corpora](https://github.com/CopticScriptorium/corpora)

## **Fine-tuning Based on microBERT**

This project fine-tunes the model based on: [https://github.com/lgessler/microbert](https://github.com/lgessler/microbert)
