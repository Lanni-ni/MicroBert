# Coptic NER with MicroBERT

This repository presents a fine-tuned Named Entity Recognition (NER) system for Coptic, leveraging **MicroBERT**, a lightweight BERT model designed for low-resource languages.


This work builds on the insights from two key papers:

- üê∞ [**Exhaustive Entity Recognition for Coptic: Challenges and Solutions**](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.792):  
 

- ü•ï [**MicroBERT: Effective Training of Low-resource Monolingual BERTs through Parameter Reduction and Multitask Learning**](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.405):
