# Coptic NER with MicroBERT

This repository presents a fine-tuned Named Entity Recognition (NER) system for Coptic, leveraging **MicroBERT**, a lightweight BERT model designed for low-resource languages.


This work builds on the insights from two key papers:

- üê∞ [**Exhaustive Entity Recognition for Coptic: Challenges and Solutions**](https://aclanthology.org/2020.latechclfl-1.3/)
- ü•ï [**MicroBERT: Effective Training of Low-resource Monolingual BERTs through Parameter Reduction and Multitask Learning**](https://aclanthology.org/2022.mrl-1.9/)

- # Coptic NER Fine-Tuning

## **Preparing the NER Dataset**

The dataset comes from two parts:

- Golden dataset  
- Silver dataset

Both are from: [https://github.com/CopticScriptorium/corpora](https://github.com/CopticScriptorium/corpora)

## **Fine-tuning Based on microBERT**

This project fine-tunes the model based on: [https://github.com/lgessler/microbert](https://github.com/lgessler/microbert)
